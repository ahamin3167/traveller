#### A Travelling Salesman Problem project, by Zach Baylin and Aashay Amin

## Info
This project is for MATH 3012 at Georgia Tech. It uses various graph theory concepts learned in the class ([lectures can be found here](https://pwp.gatech.edu/math3012openresources/)).

The goal of this project is to use graph theory to "solve" the Travelling Salesman Problem.
